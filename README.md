## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned 1 thing, that you could build the mobile version without using any flexbox, only padding. There are some cases that I don't have to use flexbox to design something actually. 

```
.container .card-sedans{
    padding: 30px;
    background-color: var(--bright-orange);
    border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [tsbsankara Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Wy_MJPDfCw&t=1357s) - This helped me realizing that I don't really have to use flexbox to create mobile design.
